# AntiX

A (very) simple script to restore legacy Twitter icon and favicon.

## Features

- [x] Title
- [x] Favicon
- [x] Logo (at the top-left corner)

## Requirements

You need a browser that supports `MutationObserver` to detect DOM changes.

## Installation

As for now, only TamperMonkey (v4.19.0) has been tested so far.

You can copy-paste the script and set it up to update automatically from this repo.
